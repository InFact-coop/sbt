## Design Workshop

SBT counts with an incredible number of creative people. As a result of this, there were a lot of great ideas designed and discussed during the design workshop.

After going through the crazy eights and the HMW, we all decided what our problem statement would be.

## The Problem

SBT needs a way to collect feedback from the customers that visit the libraries so that they can show the world the importance of the libraries in Scotland.

## Our Solution

An app that will allow the libraries' visitors to leave feedback about their experience in the libraries and how they help them everyday.

## How it works

The user will scan the QRcode with their phones and will be directed to the first page of the app (_Feauture to be implemented_).

By clicking on the bookbug or in the right folded corner, the user will be directed to the next page where he/she could state why he/she came to the library today. After this, they will be able to rate their experience.

In the following pages, the user will be able to record their voice and let us know why they love their library or why they have come to the library today.

_Feauture to be implemented_: Alternatively, if they do not want to record their voice, they could leave a written message.

Finally, they will be able to see what other users have posted in the storyboard page.

## Further Development

### User Testing

User testing allows you to get feedback from your primary users to check that the product being built fits their needs.

The three key points for testing are:

* Have a script which has tasks for them to complete
* Ask for people to give you a commentry of what they are doing, but don't response to them
* Document their response

Here are some useful resources to look at when completing your user testing sessions:

	- Googles Gurilla Testing Advice

	- Script Guidance and Template
	
	- Recommended areas to user test:


From the design sprint, we decided to focus on one of the SBT's main stakeholders: the librarians. This is why, when proceeding with the user testing, the app should be tested with the librarians and also the librarians themselves should test it with their common customers.

## Next sprint

To make this prototype, a functional mvp there will be a few feautures that will be implemented. These are:

- [ ] QR Code functional so that the users get addressed directly to their website.
- [ ] A database to collect the customers' feedback and reason for visiting the Library as well as their audio messages and written feedback.
- [ ] The possibility to share in Twitter their support messages: e.g. **#Loveyourbooks** **#SBT**
- [ ] A functional storyboard where all the users can see what other visitors have written/recorded.
